	<p class = "subsubhead">Midterm Project: <a href="https://github.com/cooperm27/GCMidterm/tree/master/src">Restaurant App</a></p>
		<p class="body">In this project we built an app that displays a restuarant menu and allows users to choose both items and quantity of items.  The app will display the correct receipt and ask users to pay by cash, check or charge.  It will then validate the responses and provide the correct change or approval if using check or card.  Users can also suggest a product and it will add it to a file.</p>
	
	<p class = "subsubhead">First List Manipulation Project: <a href="https://github.com/cooperm27/Lab_9/tree/master/src">Grocery Store App</a></p>
		<p class="body">For this project I was tasked with building a grocery app that listed products and allowed users to select a grocery list and get a total.  For this we needed to use key/values mapping for each product.</p>
	
	<p class = "subsubhead">Rock Paper Scissors Game: <a href="https://github.com/gc-submissions/lab-14-cooperm27/tree/master/src/co/grandcircus">Roshambo</a></p>
		<p class="body">My Roshambo game allows you play Rock, Paper, Scissors against several players. The first player will always choose rock, so he's pretty easy to beat.  The second player will randomly choose one of the options so he is more of a challenge.  The game will also keep track of your wins and losses.  </p>
