	<p class = "subhead"> My Experience</p>
	<p class = "body">I am just getting started in development after a successful 10 year career in digital advertising.  I spent many years as a sales strategist, and also in direct sales for Amazon selling their advertising software program.  I specialized in taking complex tools and explaining them to the average layperson in a way that was easily understood.  I also have a deep understanding of the eCommerce ecosystem and have been consulting clients on how best to grow their business outside of brick and mortar.  I hope to take this real world experience and together with new development tools create the processes and programs I wished I was selling. </p>

	<p class = "subhead"> Development Goals</p>
	<p class = "body">Early on in my career I hope to simply land somewhere that allows me the space to grow and learn.  I plan to be a sponge and listen as much as possible in order to quickly become an asset to my team.  I hope to eventually be a key contributor to projects that help make the world a better place.  I have specific interest in green technology, self driving vehicles, or any technology that democratizes opportunities for growth and development for all people. Specifically, I enjoy the back end object oriented development as I am particularly fond of logic puzzles and am fairly solid in math.  While I do plan on practicing my app and web development skills for friends and family, my ultimate goal is to work on larger more impactful projects as part of a team.

	<p class = "body">I was born in Detroit, but grew up in Wixom, Michigan.  A little history from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wixom,_Michigan">Wikepedia</a>: The settlement of Wixom dates back to 1831. In the beginning, Wixom was named Sibley's Corners after the first settler, 20 year old philanthropist Alonzo Sibley. Sibley settled in what is today called Commerce Township, where he purchased approximately 80 acres of land. Over time, Sibley purchased about 350 more acres of land. In 1837 Sibley donated a portion of his property for a local cemetery; which was called South Commerce Burial Ground; however, was later changed to Wixom Cemetery. Sibley then became the president of the cemetery association.  The establishment of Wixom as a place started in 1871 when Willard Clark Wixom (son of Ahijah C. Wixom and Lucy Clark) granted a right of way through his property for the Holly, Wayne and Monroe Railroad. Willard platted land on both sides of the railroad near the Novi and Commerce Township border. </p>
	<p class = "body"> </p>
	<p class = "body">I knew Wixom to be a wholesome town that still had a few rough edges.  The Wixom Ford Plant is no longer there, but a Menards and RV Park have taken up some of that space.  The downtown is slowly being developed and it should continue to make all other nearby towns pale in comparison.</p>
